#### WARNING
INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I am not responsible for any damage you may cause while performing this installation. While I believe this guide is a great introduction for novice users, it should be noted that there is a high risk for data loss during this procedure. It's important to take your time and double check everything before committing any major changes to your system. This tutorial is a result of hours and hours of trial and error experience so what worked for me may not work for you. That being said, if you BACK UP YOUR DATA and follow the steps exactly you should be just fine.


#### Purpose of this tutorial
This tutorial is designed for novice users who are interested in booting multiple operating systems on Apple hardware. This guide will be mostly focused on navigating and troubleshooting the many Apple-specific roadblocks you may encounter when creating a multi-boot system.
#### Hardware this was tested on
This tutorial was tested on a 2015 Macbook Pro 15" running MacOS Mojave 10.14.1 but should also work on all modern Mac variants.
#### There's always a better way!
As stated before this tutorial is a result of hours of trial and error.  Many of the steps in this tutorial are far from "official" as I had to come up with my own hacky solutions to some of the roadblocks I encountered.  While I believe this tutorial will work fine, it is still far from perfect.

#### About the author
My first attempt at dual booting linux on my MacBook was back in 2009 shortly after Apple released my personal favorite flavor of Apple's now deprecated line of "big cat" OS's, OSX Snow Leopard. Me being only 12 years old at the time definitely made the process tedious and time consuming but once I succeeded I was hooked for life. So here we are nine years, hundreds of hours on YouTube, and six corrupted drives later and I'm still dual booting my mac.
