#### WARNING
PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I am not responsible for any damage you may cause while performing this installation. While I believe this guide is a great introduction for novice users, it should be noted that there is a high risk for data loss during this procedure. It's important to take your time and double check everything before committing any major changes to your system. This tutorial is a result of hours and hours of trial and error experience so what worked for me may not work for you. That being said, if you BACK UP YOUR DATA and follow the steps exactly you should be just fine.


#### Purpose of this tutorial
This tutorial is designed for novice users who are interested in booting multiple operating systems on Apple hardware. This guide will be mostly focused on navigating and troubleshooting the many Apple-specific roadblocks you may encounter when creating a multi-boot system.

#### Target Audience
I tried my best to design this tutorial to be used by inexperienced beginners interested in experimenting with Linux without sacrificing the comfort of MacOS.  This tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of MacOS as well as a very general understanding of computer systems and hardware. Having some minimal experience with the command line will prove useful in completing this tutorial but is by no means necessary.

#### Hardware this was tested on
This tutorial was tested on a 2015 Macbook Pro 15" running MacOS Mojave 10.14.1 but should also work on all modern Mac variants.
#### There's always a better way!
As stated before this tutorial is a result of hours of trial and error.  Many of the steps in this tutorial are far from "official" as I had to come up with my own hacky solutions to some of the roadblocks I encountered.  While I believe this tutorial will work as intended, it is still far from perfect.
