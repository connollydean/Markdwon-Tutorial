## About rEFInd

rEFInd is a custom boot manager designed for UEFI based computers. rEFInd detects bootable drives on your system and displays them in a menu as shown below. We'll be using rEFInd to select your OS during every start up.

## Disabling System Integrated Protection

Before we can install rEFInd, we have to temporarily disable System Integrated Protection (SIP).  SIP is security technology that helps protect your Mac from malicious software by limiting access to certain parts of MacOS.

[Here's more info on SIP](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899)

To disable SIP we need to boot into Recovery Mode.  To do this, shut down your Mac and boot up again while holding `âŒ˜ R`

SIP can only be disabled from Recovery Mode but you can check the status of SIP by using the terminal command `csrutil status`.
