#### WARNING
INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I am not responsible for any damage you may cause while performing this installation. While I believe this guide is a great introduction for novice users, it should be noted that there is a high risk for data loss during this procedure. It's important to take your time and double check everything before committing any major changes to your system. This tutorial is a result of hours and hours of trial and error experience so what worked for me may not work for you. That being said, if you BACK UP YOUR DATA and follow the steps exactly you should be just fine.


#### Purpose of this tutorial
