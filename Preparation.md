**BACK UP YOUR DATA!**


People, I cannot stress this enough, if you are attempting to dual boot your Mac you seriously have to BACK UP YOUR DATA! Even if you have done everything exactly correct there is still a chance you could lose everything. So, unless you want to lose your secret collection of anime I highly suggest you BACK UP YOUR DATA!


#### Ways to back up your data:
**1. Time Machine**

  Time Machine is a program that comes standard with MacOS and it allows you to copy and restore full bootable backups of your MacOS system.

**3. Carbon Copy Cloner**

Carbon Copy Cloner is a paid application that allows you to save and restore bootable backups of your MacOS system with the option to store your data remotely on their servers or locally on an external drive.

*NOTE - Both Time Machine and Carbon Copy Cloner create and store "bootable backups" which means you'll be able to completely restore your system if anything goes wrong.*

**3. iCloud Drive**

iCloud Drive is cloud based data backup system that comes standard with MacOS. This is a great option for simply backing up your media rather than every file on your system.

**4. Other Cloud Based Options**

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2)

* [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

* [Box](https://app.box.com/login)


*NOTE - iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box do not allow for the creation of "bootable backups" and should only be used for storing personal files rather than storing the entire OS.*
